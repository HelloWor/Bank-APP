# Bank-APP

This mobile application is connected to an API and display the account informations of the user.

To ensure that the user is the right one starting the app the user sign in by using the fingerprint authentification provided by FingerprintManager.
To save the user's data firstly i encrypted them with cipher and then store them in the local storage of my smartphone.
To secure the API url I encrypted it with cipher write it encrypted in the code and use a decode function to use it.
